# Competitive Programming Solutions
Reference Solutions for Competitive Programming on Codeforces, SPOJ, UVA, Hackerrank, Hackerearth,â€¦

### My source code is very clean & easy to understand:
- Clean code: name of variables, functions are very easy to understand.
- Prove Time Complexity for each solution.
- Comment ideas on why that code can solve the problem.
- Sometimes I include so more than one solution for a problem. (even include TLE solutions first and then ACCEPTED solutions)

And don't forget to give me a star if you find this repository is useful for you. Thank you so much!
